# Artificial intelligence-based Legal Advisor (AILA) :judge:

[AILA](http://ailegaladvisor.de) is a prototypical webapp for information retrieval (IR) and question answering (QA) in German legal documents. 


## Project philosophy
> Legal  systems  form  the  foundation  of  democratic  states. Nevertheless, it is nearly impossible for individuals to extract specific information from comprehensive legal documents. [AILA](http://ailegaladvisor.de) takes first steps towards an AI-supported system for IR and QA in the German legal domain. 
Laypersons and legal professionals receive information supporting their research and decision-making by interacting with the architecture using a graphical interface. 
The internal language models are trained on our own annotated LegalSQuAD dataset, evaluating complex context-based search terms, considering German law-specific words and phrases.
